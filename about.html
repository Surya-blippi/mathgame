                <h2>THE OBJECTIVE: LEARNING MADE FUN</h2>
                <p><strong>Learn Fire</strong> was built on a simple premise: Education shouldn't be boring. By
                    combining the adrenaline-pumping mechanics of a First-Person Shooter (FPS) with core educational
                    concepts, we transform study time into play time.</p>

                <h2>Why "Learn Fire"?</h2>
                <p> Traditional learning apps can feel passive. In Learn Fire, every correct answer is a victory. The
                    "Gamification" of learning keeps engagement high, helping students practice longer and retain more.
                </p>
                <p>Whether you're practicing multiplication tables or learning new words, the immediate feedback loop of
                    the game makes improvement satisfying.</p>
